Subtopic: NASA's "Astronomy Picture of the Day" Viewer


Today's Tasks:
Your mission today is to build a web application that fetches and displays the daily space picture from NASA's public API.

1. Project Setup & API Key:
Set up a new Flask project. You'll need to install the requests library (pip install requests) to communicate with the API.
Go to the NASA API website and get your own free API key. It's instant. Store this key safely (e.g., in a separate config file or as an environment variable).





2. API Helper Function:
In your Flask app, write a Python function that calls the NASA APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API.
This function should use the requests library to make a GET request to the endpoint, passing your API key as a parameter. It should handle the JSON response and return the data (title, explanation, image URL, etc.).




3. Create the Main Route & Template:
Build the main route (/) for your application.
Inside this route, call your API helper function to get today's picture data.
Pass this data to an index.html template. The template should display the image, its title, the date, and the detailed explanation.




4. Add Basic Styling:
Create a style.css file and link it to your template.
Add some simple CSS to make the page look good. Center the content, give the image a max-width, and choose a clean, readable font for the text.



5. Bonus Feature: View by Date:
If you have extra time, add a date input field to your HTML page.
When a user selects a date and submits the form, it should take them to a new page (or update the current one) showing the APOD for that specific date. This will require a new route (e.g., /apod/<date>) and modifying your API call to include the date parameter.
